### Heyo! 💬

My name is Alex, a mere JS/Node developer from Moldova ready for any interesting challenge.  
Boredom kills me, so if you want me dead, give me some UI related things. But srsly, I can do anything provided there is enough coin :moneybag:  

### Professional work :city_sunrise:

I started as a freelancer on various sites, after that my first company was Endava where I worked mostly on Angular and Node.js.  
After 3 years there I moved to next company which specialized in React and I am WFH currently here.

I really enjoy modern c++ and game development, so I am creating simple stuff for the sake of my soul  
Some of this work you can see below :point_down:
