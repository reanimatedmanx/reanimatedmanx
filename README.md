<!-- Our name is `‚®â`, `Alex`, `Alexei`, `Alexander` and other `?` number of identities dear to my heart. I refer to myself as us, but you shouldn't be bothered with any of my brain's shenanigans; the usage of he/him which is closer to my appearance is **absolutely appropriate**.

üëã **Hi there!** I'm a developer with more than 10 years of experience across freelance, contract, and full-time jobs, contributing to projects in data visualization, finance, e-commerce, travel, entertainment, and game marketing. 

My core expertise is **full-stack web development**; building cross-platform apps from a single codebase using embedded webviews in the **JS/TS/Node ecosystem**, always bringing a product-focused mindset and passion for quality to every project; molding into the environment I was placed in accordingly.
