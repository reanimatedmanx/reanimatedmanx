<!-- Our name is `â¨‰`, `Alex`, `Alexei`, `Alexander` and other `?` number of identities dear to my heart. I refer to myself as us, but you shouldn't be bothered with any of my brain's shenanigans; the usage of he/him which is closer to my appearance is **absolutely appropriate**.

ðŸ‘‹ Hi there! I'm a developer with more than 10 years of experience across freelance, contract, and full-time jobs, contributing to projects in data visualization, finance, e-commerce, travel, entertainment, and game marketing. My core expertise is full-stack web development; building cross-platform apps from a single codebase using embedded webviews in the JS/TS/Node ecosystem, always bringing a product-focused mindset and passion for quality to every project; molding into the context and environment I was placed in accordingly.  
  
Formless, shapeless [like water](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJMwBwFj5nQ).

I recently re-discovered my love towards open source ðŸ’– and my own personal projects and made a commitment to devote the free time of my life to it for the rest of what is left for me.
